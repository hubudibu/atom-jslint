## Installation

You can install this plugin via the Packages manager in Atom itself or manually through the terminal

```bash
$ apm install jslint
```

## Usage

JSlint is by default validating on save (this can be changed in the package settings), you can also execute it by hitting `ctrl-alt-l`.

If you like you can even set it to validate while typing in the package settings.

## Configuration
JSlint options can be configured via `.jslintrc` config files, located in

 * your home directory *(global options)* and
 * your project root directory *(project specific options)*.

The `.jslintrc` config files are JSON files see [`.jslintrc-example`](.jslintrc-example) for an example.
Specifications of the different options can be found in the [JSlint documentation](http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#options).
